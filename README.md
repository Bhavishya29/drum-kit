# JavaScript Drum Kit

This is a simple **JavaScript Drum Kit** web application that I developed as part of the course by Wes Bos. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive musical experience right in your browser.

## Features

- Displays different keys on the screen corresponding to musical drum sounds.
- When you press a key on your physical keyboard that matches one displayed on the website, the associated drum sound plays.
- Each key has a unique sound attached to it.
- If you press any key that is **not** displayed on the screen, **no sound** will be played.
- Visual effects: When a key is pressed, the corresponding key on the screen temporarily enlarges or highlights to indicate it was triggered.
